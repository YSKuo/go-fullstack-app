- Backend: Go (Golang)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- API Communication: RESTful APIs
- Containerization: Docker

## Use Cases

- User Account System: Enables customers to create personal accounts, log in securely, and manage their profiles. This is a common requirement for membership platforms, e-commerce websites, and service-based platforms.
- Service Booking or Product Management: The backend handles data operations like creating, listing, updating, or deleting records â€” essential for online booking systems, inventory management, or content administration portals.
- Ready for Deployment: Dockerized environment ensures consistency from development to production. Ideal for teams looking to deploy their app to the cloud (e.g., AWS, GCP) with minimal DevOps setup.

## Conclusion

This project exemplifies a modern approach to web application development, combining a robust backend written in Go with a dynamic React frontend. It's an excellent reference for developers looking to understand full-stack development, and for recruiters to assess proficiency in contemporary web technologies.
